# Stock Tracker

## About the application
I wrote this web scraping app to help me to stay up to date with the latest news on the stock market. 

The app has two main functionalities. First, it helps to find out the current price of a stock you are interested in and second, it tracks the price changes over time along with the most the top news related to the selected equities.


### 1. functon:
Interactive command line tool that retrieves price info of the selected stock.
```
    python -m stock_query(<stock-ticker>)
``` 

### 2. function:
Retrieves price info and related news articles of given stocks and stores them in a database.
```
    python -m stock_tracker()
```
